# Python-Data-Structures
data structures implemented in python


to run, pass in filename as an argument.

ie:

user$./linkedlist.py filename



input file syntax is going to be a bit weird and different for each data structure but generally will be something like: 

1.in 3.in 5.in 7.in 11.in^ 12.in_3_ 2.in 22.sch 15.in_7
